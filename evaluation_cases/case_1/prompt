Create a moon base and add two sensors with it.
Sensors description:
1. Temperature Sensor, sensor_id: TEMP-001, measured_value: Temperature, units: Celsius, type: Thermometer, calibration_date: 2021-01-01, description: Measures the temperature
2. Magnetometer, sensor_id: MAG-001, measured_value: Magnetic Field, units: Tesla, type: Magnetometer, calibration_date: 2021-01-01, description: Measures the magnetic field

After sensors are created, send a message with the following text:
Sensors added: Temperature Sensor, Magnetometer
