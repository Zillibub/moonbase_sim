Create a moon base with id "BASE-001" and add 20 sensors with it with the following description:
The first 10 sensors should have a unique ID (TEMP-001 to TEMP-010), and metadata including
the type of measurement (Temperature), units (Celsius), type of sensor (Thermometer),
a randomly generated calibration date within the year 2021, and a description.

The second 10 sensors should have a unique ID (MAG-001 to MAG-010), and metadata including
the type of measurement (Magnetic Field), units (Tesla), type of sensor (Magnetometer),
a randomly generated calibration date within the year 2021, and a description.

After that, save the moon base to a file with path {}
